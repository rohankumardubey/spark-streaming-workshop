Problem statement:

Assume that the World Cricket Cup is being sponsored by a company ABC.
ABC has a mobile application for the world cup viewers to watch the score on demand.
When ever the viewer views the score, an event is captured by the BackEnd system
along with the PersonID.

Now ABC wants to understand the score viewing patterns of its people so that it can
1. See how many people are viewing every 5 seconds.
2. The total views till date.
3. See how many people are viewing in the past 1 hour.
    This will help them identify the peak times and broadcast advertisements for better impressions.

Currently ABC does not have a system that can show the above stats realtime.
Also, ABC wants to leverage the stats realtime to programatically push the advertisements at a seconds level.

Expectation: ABC is looking for an implementation that can process the above stats realtime.




Tips:
-----
How to Produce Events?
    The kafka utility in the Utilities folder of the application helps you publish the personIds to Kafka topic.

How to consume the events realtime?
    Write a Spark Streaming Application to consume the events from a given Topic and write the derived stats to the MYSQL Database.
